AmbiHue
=======

Controlling your Hue Lamps from your Windows Computer.

How to install
=======
As this program is still highly unstable and far from finished. You will have to compile it yourself with Visual Studio.
You might have to manually add your username in the settings folder. This is still be worked on.

The application uses my own fork of the SharpHue dotNet Library: https://github.com/hosjEU/SharpHue
Without this library, the application won't work!

Note
=======
A thank you to qJake for his dotNet Library that I could fork: https://github.com/qJake/SharpHue
